When you have a complex system architecture with a huge variety of services, the first question that arises is:  "What happens when I start to generate tons of events and what is the behaviour of the system when it starts to process them?". For these reasons we are devoloping a high configurable and scalable tool called Khermes that can answer this "a priori simple" question.

> "Khermes is a distributed fake data generator used in distributed environments that produces a high volume of events in a scalable way".
